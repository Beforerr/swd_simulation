- Compare $ \delta v_A ?= \delta v_i $ first
- One step back, how the RD evolve after generation?
- Velocity distribution function

### BUGS

- [x] beta and ion temperature


# TODO:

- [ ] Ion anisotropy depends on electron beta
- [ ] Dimension difference when go to 2D/3D
- [ ] Check ion gyro-radius
- [ ] Propagation direction (ion or electron sense RD)
- [ ] Why constant B? (Marco Velli)

Ion dynamics in the rotational discontinuities

Formation of rotational discontinuities from oblique linearly polarized Alfven wave trains
And ion dynamics in the vicinity of the rotational discontinuities => Hybrid Simulation


> Generally speaking the hybrid model approach has difficulty with Whistler waves that are included in the model physics but because their dispersion runs to the electron cyclotron frequency there is a point where the chosen grid and timestep resolution no longer properly resolves these waves (unless you use a very small timestep in which case the value of the hybrid approach is lost).

Numerical dispersion by whistler waves (up to electron cyclotron frequency)


The ponderomotive force (o(OB~l~/Ox) exerted by the first-order wave generates waves with twice its wavenumber which have a compressional component and a wave magnetic field in the z-direction.
